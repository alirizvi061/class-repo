## INTRO to ICEBREAKER!

Two truths and a lie (7 minutes) with Instructor Demo

- Write two truths and a lie about yourself in slack

```
1. I have never seen the Godfather
2. I am barefoot right now! 
3. I make my bed every morning without fail
```

Did it work? It'll look like this:

- If you made a mistake go ahead and fix it and send it to yourself again
- When you've got it, send it out to the `partytime` channel
- Everyone will click on 1, 2 or 3
- Once everyone in the group posts we'll find out if the class guessed your lie!
- We'll do a few rounds, everyone will get a chance
